/**
 * Provides a {@link io.scif.img.cell.cache.CacheService} interface for
 * dynamically caching and retrieving image pixel data to and from disk.
 * <p>
 * When a service is obtained, the following cache configuration options can be
 * used:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link io.scif.img.cell.cache.CacheService#enable(boolean)} to enable or
 * disable caching.</li>
 * <li>{@link io.scif.img.cell.cache.CacheService#setMaxBytesOnDisk(long)} to
 * limit the amount of disk space used by the cache (argument in bytes)</li>
 * <li>{@link io.scif.img.cell.cache.CacheService#cacheAll(boolean)} toggles
 * whether or not non-dirty are cached. By default this is {@code false} and
 * only dirty cells are cached.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Caching is enabled by default when using
 * {@link io.scif.img.cell.SCIFIOCellImg} types.
 * </p>
